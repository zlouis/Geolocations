# Geolocations
## Api used: 
###Google map Api
###Google Places Api

This project was extremely difficult, it took me approxmiately a week to complete both api. The project searches for the current user location and within that location, it searches 50,000 meters radius of that user for the 20 museums that are closest to that user. The 20 museums can be seen within the console.

###Challenges
Some of the challenges was putting the api link together. Reading the google documentation was somewhat confusing as there was no sample link that helped with the construction of the link. The second challenge was locating the user. I had many errors from "google not defined", "initMap not defined" and more. These errors took me hours to figure out why it was happening. Building the query constructor function was also a difficult task to input the latitude and longitude of the user.
